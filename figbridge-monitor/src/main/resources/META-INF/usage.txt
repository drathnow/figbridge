Properties 

    figbridgeMonitor.mqWaitSeconds  Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the Site Report
                                    message to be be received by the figbridge-monitor program,
                                    after it is sent.
                                    
    Properties can be defined in one of two ways:
    
    1. You can add them to the command line:
    
        java [-DpropertyName=propertyValue] -jar figbridge-monitor.jar
        
    2.  You can add a "Property" element to the configuration file after the
        root element (i.e. <FigBridgeMonitor>) like this:
        
            <Property name="foo" value="bar" />
        

The program does the following:

1. It will first make a connection to the bridge. The connection information is taken
   from the configuration file elements:

        <Bridge>
            <Address>IP ADDRESS</Address>
            <Port>PORT NUMBER</Port>
        </Bridge>
    
2. Authenticate with the bridge. The authentication information is taken from the configuration
   file elements:

        <Authentication>
            <Nuid>NUID</Nuid>
            <SecretKey>ENCODED_KEY</SecretKey>
        </Authentication>

    Where:    
        NUID must be a valid device identifier already defined in the Zedi Access database.
    
        ENCODED_KEY value must be a valid, Base64 encoding for a Secret Key used to authenticate with
        bridge.
    
3.  Send in a report containing a single reading value. The values for this report are generated
    internally by the program.
    
4.  Wait for a Site Report message to published to the message server that contains the values
    generated in step 3. The connection information for the message server is taken from the
    configuration element:
    
        <Jms>
            <QueueManagerName>QM_NAME</QueueManagerName>
            <HostName>HOST_NAME</HostName>
            <EventTopicName>TOPIC_NAME</EventTopicName>
        </Jms>

    Where:
        QM_NAME is the name of the message server Queue Manager
        
        HOST_NAME is the name of the host running the message server
        
        TOPIC_NAME is the name of the topic where the Site Report message is
        published.  This name must be prefixed by either "topic://" or "queue://" 
        and contain slashes (/) NOT dots (.).  For example, the existing topic
        used to publish site reports would be specified as "topic://scada/system/events".
         

Status results are written to SYSOUT in the format <NUM>:<MSG>. The NUM is a numeric
value for the error and the MSG is text associated with the error.  Values produced by
this program are:

0:SUCCESS          - All tests passed successfully.
1:CONNECT_FAILED   - Unable to connect to the bridge
2:AUTH_FAILED      - Authentication failure.
3:<MSG>            - Unable to send to message to the bridge.  The 
                     <MSG> will contain more details
3:NO_MSG_PUB       - No message published to the Message Server
99:<MSG>           - A fatal error has occured.  This may be caused by almost
                     anything.  Before restarting the bridge, check logs that contain
                     output FROM THIS PROGRAM!
