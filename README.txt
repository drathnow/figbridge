If you're reading this, you are on the branch create to update the figbridge to use modern Java and
dependent packages...or try to at least.  At this point, only some of the packages have been updates
specifically the ones required to get the fg_tester up and running so testing could be done on the 
Field Gateway. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, and it may never get done since the
FG is considered a "mature" product.

Once all the work has been complete, I would suggest either updating this file to reflect that
or simply deleting it.  Do not merge it into the main branch.
